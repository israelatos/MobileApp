Great! Let's move on to Step 2: Frontend Development. In this step, we'll set up your React Native project and start building the user interface for your app.

### Step 2: Frontend Development

1. **Install Software:**
   - Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Open your terminal or command prompt to check if Node.js and npm are installed by running:
     ```
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   
2. **Install Expo CLI:**
   - Expo is a toolchain that helps you build React Native apps easily. Install Expo CLI globally by running:
     ```
     npm install -g expo-cli
     ```

3. **Create a New React Native Project:**
   - Choose a directory where you want to create your project.
   - Open your terminal and navigate to that directory:
     ```
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```
   - Create a new React Native project using Expo:
     ```
     expo init MyAppName
     ```
   - Choose a template. For beginners, I recommend starting with the "blank" template.
   - Navigate to your project folder:
     ```
     cd MyAppName
     ```

4. **Run Your App:**
   - Start the development server by running:
     ```
     expo start
     ```
   - This will open a web page in your browser with a QR code.

5. **Preview Your App:**
   - Install the Expo Go app on your smartphone from the App Store or Google Play Store.
   - Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code from the web page.
   - You should now see your app running on your phone!

6. **Edit the User Interface:**
   - Open the project in your code editor. You can use Visual Studio Code or any editor you prefer.
   - Navigate to the `App.js` file.
   - This is your app's main entry point. You'll start building your user interface here.

7. **Add Components:**
   - React Native uses components to build the UI. Common components include `View`, `Text`, `Button`, and `TextInput`.
   - Replace the default content in `App.js` with your own components. For example:
     ```jsx
     import React from 'react';
     import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
     
     function App() {
       return (
         <View>
           <Text>Hello, this is my app!</Text>
         </View>
       );
     }
     
     export default App;
     ```

8. **Style Your App:**
   - Use inline styles or stylesheets to format your components. You can use the `style` prop to apply styles.
   - For example:
     ```jsx
     <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
       <Text style={{ fontSize: 24, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Welcome to My App</Text>
     </View>
     ```

9. **Continue Building:**
   - Add more components and design elements to create the layout you sketched earlier.
   - Experiment with different components, styles, and layouts to bring your app to life.

Remember, this is just the beginning of your frontend development journey. As you build and experiment, you'll gain a better understanding of how React Native works and how to create engaging user interfaces.

When you're ready, we can move on to Step 3: Backend Development, where we'll set up the server-side of your app using Node.js and Express.js. Let me know if you're ready to proceed!
